Overview
	Create a calculator application that will allow the user to perform simple arithmetic calculations using a physical calculator-like user interface.

User Interface
	The design of the user interface should have a similar appearance to a physical hand-held calculator.
	It should have numeric 0-9 buttons, plus, minus, multiply and divide buttons, as well as an equals button.
	It should have a Clear All (C) button, and a Clear Entry (CE) button.
	It should have a Square Root button, a Percent button, a Negate (+/-) button, and an inverse (1/x) button.
	It should have a numeric display area to show the result value.
