# AThousandCalculators
How many ways can you build a calculator? Let's find out...

What is the best way to build software?  What are the best tools?  The best designs?  The best platforms?  The best architecture?

These are the questions that this project will attempt to answer.  By creating the same calculator application using different tools and techniques, we will try to find the quickest, simplest, fastest, smallest, and best approaches to software development.

Browse through the different implementations, or contribute your own solution and help us find the ultimate architecture to answer the question once and for all.
