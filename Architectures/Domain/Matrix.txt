Matrix Architecture
	An architecture that places all logic, functionality and virtual software representations of real-world objects inside of a virtual sandbox.

Rules
	All real-world components of the system, including users, must be replicated virtually in the sandbox in software.
	In addition to users, all physical hardware must be replicated inside of the sandbox.  This includes:
		Monitors, screens, desktop applications, web pages, web browser applications, disk drives, keyboards, mice, network adapters, switches, internet gateways, web services, databases, etc.

Summary
	The sandbox provides a self-contained environment that can be designed and tested without any need for real-world hardware or users.
	Applications and libraries can be created to link virtual sandbox components to real-world components.
	These applications/libraries ensure that events that occur in the real world are properly triggered in the sandbox.
	They also ensure that real world devices are notified when observable changes occur in the sandbox.
	As the sandbox components have no awareness or dependency of any real-world hardware, it is possible to reuse these virtual components with on any platform.
